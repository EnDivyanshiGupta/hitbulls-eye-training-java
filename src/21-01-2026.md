# Method Overloading Example – Multiply Program

## Objective
To understand method overloading in Java using multiple `multiply()` methods.

---

## Concepts Covered
- Method Overloading
- Static Keyword
- Nested Class
- Main Method

---

## Source Code

```java
public class Demo {

    static class Demo1 {

        void multiply(int a, int b) {
            System.out.println("Result is " + (a * b));
        }

        void multiply(int a, int b, int c) {
            System.out.println("Result is " + (a * b * c));
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Demo1 obj = new Demo1();
            obj.multiply(8, 5);
            obj.multiply(4, 6, 2);
        }
    }
}
```

## Output

```
Result is 40
Result is 48
```

---

## Explanation

- Two methods named `multiply()` are created with different parameters.
- This is called **Method Overloading**.
- The correct method is selected based on the number of arguments passed.
- The `main()` method is declared `static` because JVM calls it directly.
- `Demo1` is declared `static` so it can be accessed inside the static `main()` method.
